First code
Used prompt:

The plot of a 2d platformer (scrolling platformer) is given: 
“The Lost Firefly”   
Plot: In a magical forest where eternal night reigns, a little firefly named Sparkle loses his source of light - magic pollen. Without it, he cannot light his way and risks getting lost forever.   
Plot: Sparkle sets off on a journey through a dark forest full of dangers and riddles to find his lost pollen. He must overcome obstacles, solve puzzles based on the use of light and shadow, and avoid encounters with nocturnal predators.   
The ending: Sparkle finds the pollen and regains his light, illuminating the dark forest and helping other lost creatures.  

Create the first level for this game in python and pygame. The level should be in a separate file (.json) and the code should use sprites (ground.png, char.png, enemy1.png, bg.png)

Create .dir

add assets of the game
these assets were made by Google Gemini

Fixed mistakes (more info in description)
prompt: Here are the bugs that were found: the character does not turn to the left if he walks to the left; instead of the floor picture, the gray platform from level1.json ( {“x”: 0, “y”: 450, “width”: 800, “height”: 50},) is used; the character does not react to the enemy in any way; the character can go outside of the level left and right
-
Added scrolling to the level
Detected bug: player cannot go further after the second platform.

Prompts:
1) "Add scrolling to a platformer game. Don't write full code, but only those parts where you need to add something. But those parts where you need to add something - write the whole code." (code and json were given)
2) Fix a bug where platforms were disappeared (camera_x & camera_y were added by Gemini);
3) "Make changes to the code so that background would not move with the platforms" (Gemini added "screen.blit(bg_img, (0, 0))").

Fixed scrolling (more info in the description)
Now the player can go further than x = 800

Prompts: 
1) "Fix a bug where player cannot go further than 800 per x" (Gemini suggested 3 methods of solving this problem: making the level infinite, limit movement to level boundaries and combined option - soft boundary with level boundaries);
2) "Fix a bug using third method" (Gemini provided this code)
-
